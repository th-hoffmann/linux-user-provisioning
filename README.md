## 📖 Description

This repository, **`linux-iac-user-setup`**, contains the **`iac-provisioning.sh`** script, developed as part of **[DIO's Linux Fundamentals Training](https://web.dio.me/track/linux-fundamentals)**. The project's goal is to automate the setup of the entire user, group, and directory infrastructure on a Linux server, applying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts.

The script ensures that when run on a new virtual machine, the entire permission structure is configured in a standardized and automated way, ready for use.

## 🚀 Features

The **`iac-provisioning.sh`** script performs the following actions:

- ✔️ **Group Creation:** Creates the `GRP_ADM`, `GRP_VEN`, and `GRP_SEC` user groups.
- ✔️ **Directory Creation:** Creates the `/public`, `/adm`, `/ven`, and `/sec` directories.
- ✔️ **Permission Assignment:**
    - Sets the `root` user as the owner of all directories.
    - Assigns the respective groups as owners of their specific directories.
    - Applies full permissions for the owner and the corresponding groups.
    - Prevents other users from having permissions in the restricted directories.
    - Allows full access for all users to the `/public` directory.
- ✔️ **User Creation:** Creates predefined users and adds them to their respective groups.
